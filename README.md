# Detection of defects from ultrasonic images using deep learning methods

This is a team project that was assigned on the fifth semester of FER.
The goal of the project was to determine whether defects in material exist in the image using deep learning methods. Also, the model was to be inspected using the GradCam method.

Images are taken using ultrasonic devices. The model is made to help inspectors find defects in the construction of nuclear power plants. Since the matter is delicate there are few datasets publicly avalible. The dataset used is obtained from a paper "Augmented Ultrasonic Data for Machine Learning" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10921-020-00739-5).

VGG and EfficientNet models were trained, both achieving 100% test accuracy. The high accuracy is expected due to the dataset being heavily augmented. We were satisfied with the obtained results.

Since I worked on EfficientNet, GradCam and presentation only I will not upload the VGG model.
